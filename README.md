# SpriteAnimator
A script for Unity3D which handles sprite animation in Sprite Renderer.

Create an animation by providing a name, frame rate, if it is looping and finally the sprites to play. By typing the right string in the variable SequenceCode which is documented, there is no need for the sprites to be in order or duplicates to play the animation. Also you can add a queue to an other animation when this finishes and it'll continue on its own. Finally you can add triggers to any frame to dispatch messages.

I am not the original author of the script. I found it on PasteBin by someone who mentioned it. I've added some extra functions, fixed some bugs, and put on some work on the comments.
